Automatic extraction and parsing of Snapchat for iOS and Android

Install required libraries with 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To be able to decrypt the iOS memories database you will need to have sqlite3.exe in PATH.
Download https://www.sqlite.org/download.html or https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools and add that folder to PATH.

1. Copy Snapchat_Auto_vX.py and scripts folder together (Or Snapchat_Auto_vX.exe)
2. Run Snapchat_Auto_vX.py or Snapchat_Auto_vX.exe
3. Choose iOS/Android
4. Point to your extraction ZIP-file
5. Point to your keychain file (For decryption of cached memories/MEO on iOS)
6. Profit

## Memories media report (iOS)

The iOS run also produces a **Memories** report (`<output>/Memories/Memories.html`) that links
each Snapchat Memory to *all* of its recovered media — images **and videos** — from both the
`SCContent` files (`Documents/com.snap.file_manager_*`) and the `caching-media/**/*.pack` cache.
For every media file it shows the full **on-device source path** and its **MD5 + SHA-256**; for
every Memory it shows the per-snap **AES key/IV**, all **timestamps** from `scdb-27` — both
snap-level (`ZGALLERYSNAP`) and entry/album-level (`ZGALLERYENTRY`) — the CDN **URLs**,
dimensions, duration, camera, IDs, and **geolocation** (coordinates + reverse-geocoded place,
with a map link). When a device has **multiple Snapchat users**, the report is split into
per-user sections with a navigation bar linking to each.

- **Hashes:** SCContent media is AES-CBC with PKCS#7 padding, and different tools emit the media
  with or without that padding. By default the report lists **both** MD5/SHA-256 pairs (padding
  stripped — matching e.g. Cellebrite PA 10.10 — *and* padding kept) so you can match either
  tool. Choose *Without padding only* / *With padding only* in the GUI (or `--padding
  strip|keep`) to show just one. The media file saved to disk is the byte-exact (stripped) media
  unless you pick "with padding only".
- **Timestamps:** shown in **local time** by default (DST-aware). Choose **UTC** or a specific
  timezone in the GUI (or `--tz utc|America/Toronto|-04:00`); IANA zone names apply daylight
  saving correctly per date.
- **Video posters:** when a video Memory has a recovered `.mp4` but no cached still image, a
  poster frame is extracted from the video for the thumbnail. It is clearly labelled *poster
  (generated)* / source *generated* — a derived artifact, not original device data.

- Works for both key storage schemas and for multiple Snapchat users on one device.
- Regular-memory imagery on newer Snapchat decrypts **without** a keychain. A
  full-filesystem keychain (with `egocipher`/`persistedkey`) is required for **geolocation**,
  for **My Eyes Only**, and for older extractions where the keys live in `gallery.encrypteddb`.

Run it standalone on an already-unzipped extraction:

```
python -m scripts.memories_media_report <extraction_root_or_app_container> [keychain.plist] [output_dir]
```

See [docs/snapchat_ios_memories_decryption.md](docs/snapchat_ios_memories_decryption.md) for
how the decryption and linking work, and exactly when the keychain is required.

## What this fork adds

Relative to [upstream](https://github.com/DFIR-HBG/Snapchat_Auto):

- The **Memories media report** described above (`scripts/memories_media_report.py`), which links
  each Memory to all of its recovered media, including the `caching-media/**/*.pack` cache, and
  adds geolocation, hashes and source paths.
- **Compatibility fixes** for pandas 3.x / Python 3.14 and for newer Snapchat iOS schemas — see
  [docs/pandas3_python314_compat.md](docs/pandas3_python314_compat.md).
- `uv` project setup (`pyproject.toml`) and a Nuitka build script.
